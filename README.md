# Sanity Dataset Management

## Synching Staging Dataset to Production Dataset and vice versa

Here's a basic outline of how to sync content between two datasets:
Export from Source Dataset: Use the Sanity CLI to export the content from the source dataset.

bash

sanity dataset export source-dataset path/to/export.tar.gz
Import to Target Dataset: Use the Sanity CLI to import the content into the target dataset.

bash

sanity dataset import path/to/export.tar.gz target-dataset --replace
The --replace flag will replace the entire target dataset with the imported data. Be careful with this, as it will overwrite the target dataset completely.
Use Aliases for Promotion: If you're ready to promote your staging dataset to production, you can use dataset aliases to do this without affecting the actual datasets.

bash

sanity dataset alias set staging-dataset production
This command will point the production alias to the staging dataset, effectively making it the new production dataset.

## Switching between Datasets / Environments

Switch between datasets: To switch between datasets, you will need to change the NODE_ENV environment variable. If you're running your application locally, you can set NODE_ENV to development to use the staging dataset or to production to use the production dataset.

`NODE_ENV=development npm start # Use staging dataset`

`NODE_ENV=production npm start # Use production dataset`
